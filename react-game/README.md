# React South Park Click Game

This game was designed to learn Reactjs. Click each image to score a point. If you click the same
image more than once, you lose. Click all images to "win". Your score will be tracked as you click. 
If you "lose" your high score will be logged. If you lose, an alert will pop up and will let you restart the game.
